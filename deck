Origin games are experiencing the following issue:
They install the Origin client and run fine while online
When launching with no internet connection, they bring up the Origin "sign in" page every time the game launches
You can't sign in to the sign-in page, and it says "You must be online when logging in for the first time" if you try
Since you can't sign in, you can't launch the game

Here's the workaround:

Go online

Go to desktop mode (via the Power menu)

Open Steam in desktop mode

Launch the game in desktop mode

In the game's settings, set the game to play in windowed mode, rather than fullscreen. This should enable you to browse in desktop mode while the game is running.

With the game running in windowed mode, open the Origin client by clicking the icon in the taskbar

In the top left corner of the Origin window, open the Origin dropdown and select Sign Out

This will open a dialog box that say "Unable to exit because (game) is open". LEAVE THIS DIALOG BOX OPEN.

Exit the game. Because the dialog box is open, Origin will stay open instead of exiting automatically.
Close the dialog box

Select Origin -> Sign Out again. This time, it will actually allow you to sign out.

Sign in again, and be certain to check "Keep me signed in"

Feel free to mess around with any other Origin settings you want, then exit Origin, close out of everything, and go back to gaming mode
Be sure to go back to fullscreen mode in the game's settings next time you launch it

Now, when you try launching the game in offline mode, it will still bring up the sign-in page, but it will have your username filled in already and YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SIGN IN AND PLAY THE GAME!!

Unfortunately, you will have to repeat this process for every single Origin game you want to play in offline mode, but at least it's possible.
